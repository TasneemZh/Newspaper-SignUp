The site is published at https://tasneemzh-newspaper.herokuapp.com/

HTML + CSS + Bootstrap + JavaScript + API

-----------------

You can open the site through your local server on 3000 port by typing:

- the URL: "http://localhost:3000/"

**and** 

- "nodemon [app.js]" on your HyperTerminal

-----------------

You have to replace the *API key* and *Audience key* by making an account on MailChimp (For more details, see app.js comments)

Your changes take effect on your local server but not the site unless you deploy your git on Heroku after making an account on Heroku

-----------------

Make sure to:

- update your local repository on Git (type on HyperTerminal: git add . THEN git commit -m "your message")

**and**

- push your local repository to the remote repository of your Heroku (type on HyperTerminal: git push heroku master)

-----------------

NOTE: If you didn't have a remote repository then type on HyperTerminal: heroku create [your-site-name]
